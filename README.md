QPCR Data Analysis Tool
Introduction
This tool is designed to analyze qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) data from an Excel file generated by a qPCR machine. It reads the data from the Excel file, performs calculations, and outputs the results in various formats.

Features
Read qPCR data from an Excel file.
Calculate delta CT values for each sample.
Calculate 2âˆ’Delta CT values for each sample's delta CT.
Pivot the data to arrange samples as rows and target names as columns.
Save the processed data to an Excel file.

Usage
Install the required Python libraries by running:
pip install pandas openpyxl
Place your qPCR data Excel file (RUN1.xls, RUN2.xls, etc.) in the project directory.
Modify the excel_file variable in the Python script (qpcr_analysis.py) to specify the filename of your Excel file.
Run the Python script (qpcr_analysis.py) using the following command:
python qpcr_analysis.py
The script will read the data from the Excel file, perform calculations, and display the results in the terminal.
The processed data will be saved to an Excel file named output_data.xlsx in the project directory.

Example
Suppose you have qPCR data in an Excel file named 2024-02-15_084806(RUN1).xls. After running the script, it will read the data, perform calculations, and save the processed data to output_data.xlsx.
